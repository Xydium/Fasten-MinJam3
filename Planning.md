<h2>Game Pitch

Your priceless, one-of-a-kind, solid plastic 56k modem signed by Sir Tim Berners Lee himself has been lost in your eternally-growing pile of defunct electronics only 90's kids will remember. Now you must dig through your hoarded 'antique treasures' to find it again -- but don't damage anything in the process!
<h2>Mechanics
 - Latch onto and swing from the components to propel yourself to the bottom of the pile
     - Use Arrow Keys/WASDs to accelerate around a component while attached
         - Speed gained in this fashion does not decay, and can only be lost by holding onto a component for too long
         - <b>Should grappling pull towards the component or accelerate around it?</b>
     - Use Space to detach from a component at just the right moment
         - Detaching at a near-perfect right angle (+/- 1 degrees) gives a massive temporary boost while also preventing new components from spawning so collisions aren't forced
 - Do not directly collide with the components, as this will destroy them
